# sabermetric_calculations

This is a project I have been working on sparingly where I work to calculate sabermetrics using D3 (MIAA Conference) Baseball stats using R completely for fun. The full text to this is located in baseballr_miaa.docx, which is here in the repo for download. Code is in the rmd file. 

To do's: Currently looking to expand to all D3 using baseballr package. 
Also - have some ideas for time series modeling but worried about their accuracy given the absence of the 2020 season
